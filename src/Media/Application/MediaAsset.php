 * One stored media file as the media library hands it to the rest of the application.

 * against the store's own record of them, so holding a `MediaAsset` means the payload exists, matches
 * the recorded size, and carries a media type the CMS is willing to serve. Callers may therefore
 * stream `$path` and echo `$mimeType` without revalidating anything.
 *
 * `$deletable` separates uploads under the writable media root from the read-only assets shipped with
 * the distribution, which the administrator interface lists but must never offer to remove.

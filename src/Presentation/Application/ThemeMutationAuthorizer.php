 * Port deciding whether an actor may change which theme is bound to a presentation surface.

 * `themes.administrator.manage` are separate capabilities — so an editor trusted with the public look of
 * a site cannot reach the back-office chrome. `DoctrineExtensionManager` consults this on every template
 * install, activation, and removal, and an implementation is expected to re-read the grant from durable
 * storage rather than trust the caller's token, so a revocation takes effect immediately.

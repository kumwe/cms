 * replace login views or controller-specific pages, so the theme's own loader is wrapped here with the
 * override contract the theme was activated against — `layout.twig` and its `@admin-theme` alias.
 * Every other name is refused, which lets the core loader chained behind this one answer it and keeps
 * the theme's reach auditable from a single list. The wrapped loader is never consulted for a name the
 * contract does not carry, so a theme cannot influence resolution by shipping extra files.

 * install, an activation, or a trust-key rotation: this class takes the extension lifecycle lock, then
 * the cross-process `extension-registry` Redis lease, then allocates a database fence, and hands the
 * inner service a lease carrying both. It is the implementation the container binds for the confirmed
 * `theme:administrator:recover` command, and is not reachable from HTTP.

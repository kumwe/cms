 * Sink that application use cases hand a finished audit record to.

 * cannot store: the surrounding rollback is what stops the trail from disagreeing with the data.
 * The port is deliberately write-only — audit history is read back through administration queries,
 * never through this interface — which lets application code depend on the obligation to record
 * without knowing whether the trail lands in the database, a file, or a test double.

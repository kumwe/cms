/**
 * Records audit events as rows in the prefixed `audit_events` table over a Doctrine DBAL connection.
 *
 * This is the recorder the container wires for production. It writes on the same connection the calling
 * use case opened its transaction on, so an event commits with the change it describes and disappears
 * with it on rollback — the property that lets application code treat recording as part of the mutation
 * rather than as a follow-up. Doctrine converts the occurrence time and the metadata array through its
 * `datetime_immutable` and `json` types, which is why the row is built from `AuditEvent::metadata()`
 * rather than the pre-encoded string. Nothing here buffers, batches, or retries: a rejected insert
 * propagates and takes the surrounding transaction down with it, which is the intended failure mode
 * for an audit trail that must not silently lose entries.

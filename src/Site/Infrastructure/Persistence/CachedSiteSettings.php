 * Redis read cache in front of `DoctrineSiteSettings`, wired as the `SiteSettings` the container hands out.
 *
 * Nearly every public request reads the settings document — for the homepage nomination, the primary
 * menu handle and the presentation contract — and none of those reads has an actor, so the
 * unauthenticated `current()` answer is held in Redis for five minutes and only a miss reaches SQL.
 * Nothing else is cached: the administration read is capability-checked per call, and both writers go
 * straight to the database and drop the cached copy afterwards, so a saved change shows up on the next
 * request instead of when the entry expires. Dropping after the write rather than before is what keeps
 * a rejected write from leaving readers on a cache that disagrees with the table. SQL stays the source
 * of truth; the cache only saves the query.

/**
 * Terminates the middleware pipeline with a problem document when nothing else claimed the request.

 * Mezzio pipes this last, so it only ever runs for a request that no route matched and no middleware
 * answered. It replies in `application/problem+json` rather than HTML so that an API client — the caller
 * most likely to fall through the pipeline — gets a machine-readable refusal it can branch on. The body
 * is a fixed document that never echoes the requested target, which keeps an unmatched path from
 * confirming anything about the routing table. Public site pages are not served from here: a miss under
 * the site routes reaches `PublishedContentHandler`, which renders an HTML page instead.

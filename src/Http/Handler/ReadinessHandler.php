/**
 * Answers the readiness probe a load balancer uses to decide whether this worker may take traffic.
 *
 * Where liveness only asks whether the process is alive, readiness asks whether it would serve correct
 * responses right now. A worker that has not yet compiled its extension runtime map, or whose compiled
 * map has gone stale against the shared registry, would render pages from the wrong extension set — so
 * it reports 503 and is drained until the map is rebuilt, rather than quietly serving stale output. The
 * decision itself is delegated to a `ReadinessStatus` probe, so what counts as ready stays a runtime
 * concern and the delivery layer only maps the verdict onto a status code.

 * response? So the handler deliberately touches nothing — no database, no cache, no filesystem — because
 * a dependency outage must never be reported as a dead process and get a healthy worker killed while it
 * is waiting for that dependency to come back. The complementary question, whether the worker is fit to
 * receive real traffic, belongs to `ReadinessHandler`.

/**
 * Serves published content at whatever public path the site's navigation gives it.
 *
 * This is the catch-all of the public site: it takes the requested path, asks `PublicPageLocator` which
 * published record — if any — lives there, and renders it. Because one record is reachable by several
 * paths (its slug, its position in a menu, `/pages/{slug}`, or `/` when it is the homepage), the handler
 * also owns canonicalisation. A request that arrives on a non-canonical path is answered with a
 * permanent 308 to the canonical one, query string intact, so links, caches, and search results converge
 * on a single URL per page rather than splitting across duplicates.
 *
 * Missing, unpublished, and reserved paths all produce the same minimal HTML 404, which keeps the
 * existence of draft, scheduled, or trashed content out of the public response.
 *
 * @since  2.0.1

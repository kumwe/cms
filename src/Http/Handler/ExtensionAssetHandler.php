/**
 * Streams a built file from an installed extension's asset directory, and only while it stays trusted.
 *
 * Extension build output is not published by the web server directly, because serving it is a policy
 * decision rather than a file lookup. Every single request re-asks the registry whether the owning
 * extension is still active, whether the installed release is still verified, and whether the signing
 * key behind that verification is enabled, unrevoked, and inside its validity window. Disabling an
 * extension or revoking its key therefore takes its assets offline on the next request, with no cache to
 * purge — which is also why the responses it does serve are marked private and `no-store`.
 *
 * The handler is equally the boundary that keeps the asset root sealed. A path must match the
 * `vendor/name/version/file` shape, must not contain `..`, must resolve inside the root, and must not
 * traverse a symbolic link at any segment, so neither a crafted URL nor a link planted in the build
 * output can read a file elsewhere on the host. Every refusal — bad shape, untrusted extension, missing
 * file — is the same bare 404, so probing teaches a caller nothing about what is installed.
 *
 * @since  2.0.1

 * pipeline: a client that announces more than the configured budget is answered 413 without the body
 * being parsed or buffered. Because the check is on the declaration rather than the wire, a request
 * that sends no `Content-Length` — a chunked upload, or a bodyless GET — passes through; bounding the
 * bytes actually transferred remains the web server's job. This is a cheap first line of defence, not

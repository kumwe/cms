 * the error boundary logs it, `ExecutionContext` carries it into the domain, and the client receives
 * it in `X-Request-ID` to quote in a support report. A caller may supply the identifier so a trace can
 * be stitched across services, but only when it matches a conservative pattern; anything else is
 * replaced with fresh random hex, which keeps an untrusted client from steering log content or header
 * syntax through the value.

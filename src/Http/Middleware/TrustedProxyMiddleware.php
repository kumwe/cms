 * forwarding header is then stripped from the request, which makes this middleware the single place
 * the decision is made: nothing further down the pipeline can re-derive a client address or a host
 * from headers already judged here. Downstream code reads `ATTRIBUTE_CLIENT_ADDRESS` and the
 * normalised URI instead, which is why this runs ahead of host checking, rate limiting and

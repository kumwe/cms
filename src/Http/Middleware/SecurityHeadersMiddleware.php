 * ship without it. `SecurityHeaders` owns the policy itself; this middleware decides only the two
 * things that depend on the live request — whether HSTS may be asserted, and whether the response is
 * an SVG. HSTS is withheld outside production and off plain HTTP so a development host is never pinned
 * to TLS, and an `image/svg+xml` response is additionally sandboxed because an SVG is an active
 * document the browser would otherwise run with the site's own origin.

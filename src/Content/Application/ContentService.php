 * validate the payload against the content type's published schema, apply the change to the domain
 * entry under the version the caller believed it held, then commit the row, its revision snapshot and
 * its audit event inside a single transaction. Nothing else may write content, which is what keeps
 * optimistic concurrency, revision history and the audit trail from drifting apart.
 *
 * Reads are filtered per record rather than in SQL, because whether an actor may see an entry is a
 * policy question the gateway answers; that is why `list()` and `browse()` over-fetch in batches and
 * count only the records that survive. The service also adapts to what it is given: a
 * `SiteScopedContentRepository` earns the site-bounded lookups, a `ContentSearchRepository` unlocks
 * `browse()`, and the content model collaborators are optional so a minimal installation still runs on
 * the built-in page type and the built-in workflow.
